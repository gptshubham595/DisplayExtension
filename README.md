# Copy Markup Markdown

This extension is made for cool people who like to take notes in markdown format. Having to copy content from the web then manually converting them to markdown format is a huge pain. Especially for formatting for code blocks and inline code. 

Select text / code blocks from a page then you can access the copy menu from either the browser extension button or the context menu from right clicking. The menu items will be dependent on if there were any selection on the page.
